# Alternative Theories
**P3-P10**

The first articles of the book is trying to argue that 
while science is based on “empirical evidence”, other seemingly ridiculous claims, 
like the FSM Theory of Gravity, can also be. 
Also, as science is based on the work of past - and dead - scientists, 
it is impossible to have them defend their own points and to know what they are really for. 
This suggests that science can also be full of logical errors and unproven assumptions, 
just as the system of any other “alternate theories”.

So, as my personal deduction, science can  in some ways be considered a religion; 
it is based on nothing but models and math, 
it generated a system out of those things,
 and it tries to explain the world for people.

(What about rituals and/or religious belongings?  
Well, not to mention religions don’t *require* rituals, 
aren’t laboratory requirements and publication-related regulations similar to “rituals”?)
