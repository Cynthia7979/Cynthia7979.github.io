## A beautifully and faithfully made adaptation.
... And I **loved** it.

It is by far the only Lovecraft adaptation that had fully immersed me into its world and terror.  The graphics and sound effects are top-ranked and didn't disappoint me at any point in the process, and the trivia, though sometimes seem interruptive, acted as an brief opportunity for me to get back into the reality and take a break from the mind-blowing atmosphere of the game.

When reading Lovecraftian novels, I always encounter a problem of having my attention drift off and losing the thread of the story, but this isn't a thing in this game. Its plain yet never monotonic voice-acting blended into the environmental sounds, making sure that you followed the narrative while still preserving the realism of the fictional world. 

I really look forward to the next game of this type from the devs. Also, a huge thank you to the devs for making this wonderful game free to play!
