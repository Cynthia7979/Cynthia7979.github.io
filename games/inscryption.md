**If you're already interested in this game and is considering whether or not you should spend the money, do it right now. You won't regret it.**

Some say that good video games should be an experience. Others insist that games should be fun to play. Inscryption is the one that achieves them both. It has the excellent plot and rhythm like does a novel, the soundtrack of a modern industrial musical, and the mechanism that on its own deserves to be Game of the Year. It is one of those games that I can put in the same category with Portal 2, the "must buy" on every list.

As one that does poor on games that require much thinking, I didn't find Inscryption hard at all. To be frank, the game is almost helping me whenever I get stuck; it's almost as if it would like to show all it has to you. Although this makes the game last shorter (as you can see, 17.2 hours for me), you can always go back and play again, and you will always be "trapped" inside thanks to its enjoyable mechanism.

Take my words; try this game out and the chances are it'll become your new favorite.
