*2/10*
{:.center}

As one accustomed to watching long and stylized films, I naturally decided to watch Season 1 of *End of the F\*\*\*king World* in one sit.

Spoiler alert: I didn't succeed. 

So what caught my eyes on this series was its attractive - if not somewhat cliche - character settings. James was a 17 y.o. high schooler who was also a psychopath. Alyssa was an angry high schooler who somehow gets along with James. I mean, even though I began expecting to see James kill Alyssa (or even just attempt doing it), it can still be one of those dark comedy romance, like those sweet vampire romance films. Nothing could ever go wrong, could it?

Oh yes it could.

The thing is, quite literally *everything* that attracted me into watching this series were **not** in the series. 

Like, they may have existed for a split second, and they're gone forever. *Lightheartedness?* Only the heavy weight of reality. *Comedy?* I did legitimately laugh at it before the second episode, but never after. *Dark?* Only if James could kill a few more people! *Realism?* Even that's not enough. *Sarcasm?* Not even attempted *Romance?* Just no.

And yes. After three hours of trying to withstand the season and get to the ending, I gave up. I went and got up the synopsis on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_the_F***ing_World#Episodes) and basically educated myself on everything that's gonna happen in the first and the next season. Trust me, they're not getting any better.

I'm not saying the show is horrible or confusing to watch. The thing is, the producers seem to had tried out everything, but there's not enough of anything. No matter I try to watch it as a horror movies enjoyer, a dark comedy fan, or seriously just one who wants to watch some sweet romance, the film always appear lame. It's, just, mediocre. Underwelming. And rather lengthy.

So, even though I hadn't finished this whole thing - and most probably never will - I still don't recommend this series to anyone. Sure, there's skills in editing and cinematography and lighting (sometimes it's quite *noir* to be honest), but as a webseries it's just too painful to watch it in its entirety. 2/10 for being an average "film", and 0/10 for being such an underwhelming "story".
