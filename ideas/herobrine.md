# (Possibly) Why Herobrine Was Created

So recently I saw this meme at [ImgFlip](https://imgflip.com/i/5zcec6)...

![Herobrine meme](https://i.imgflip.com/5zcec6.jpg)

... and it reminds me of liminal spaces. Remember, this picture went viral in 2010, when *Minecraft Alpha* was all that's there. After the more "complete" and "realistic" version came out, Herobrine is no longer a plausible legacy but merely a well-known creepypasta.

Is it possible that **the liminal-spaces-like atmosphere in Minecraft Alpha is responsible for "creating" Herobrine**, that the sole reason why Herobrine was a thing was because people were afraid of Minecraft Alpha?

Well, there's only one way to find out...

## What is a Liminal Space?
The [Aesthetics Wiki](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Liminal_Space) defines liminal space as:

> A "transitional space" that relates to *eeriness*, *nostalgia*, and the *fear of locations being presented "out of context."* 
 
 Popular definitions of liminal spaces usually focus on the nostalgic aspect, but personally I prefer the "eeriness" definition. I think liminal space triggers not only nostalgia, but more importantly, the "uncanny valley" for locations; the latent danger conveyed through the mildly manipulated parts in a photography.

Take this image for example:

![name one thing](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000485122030.jpg)

This is not a liminal space image, but it certainly generates a similar feeling: Everything seems familiar, but we can't identify any of them. Liminal space is similar, except that even though everything IS solidly identifiable and familiar, we still can't recognize **where** and **when** this location took a part in. 

Visualize this feeling, and we'll get some of the most viral liminal space photos:

See anything in common?
1. **They're all unusually empty**. There's no people, no decorations, no tableware, nothing.
2. **The "far end" of the picture is unclear**. It could be foggy, dark, overexposed, blocked, or just not included in the frame.
3. Although being pictures shot in real world, **they still look remotely unrealistic**. This unreality could come from the low quality of the picture (making it hard to identify individual objects), artificial/impossible lighting (look closely at the first example), or color manipulation that pushes us straight into the uncanny valley (apparent from the second example, aka "Backrooms").

## How Is Minecraft Linked to Liminal Spaces?
As mentioned before, the early versions of Minecraft are, visually and functionally, very different from the current ones. This can especially be seen in Minecraft Classic ([playable version here](https://classic.minecraft.net/)). This is the predecessor of Minecraft Infdev, Alpha, and Beta, versions published during when Herobrine became a thing.

A screenshot of Minecraft Alpha, survival mode ([source](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/survival-mode/2910659-skyblock-in-minecraft-alpha))

Surely quite a number of things have been added; the player can now use tools and the crafting table, there is a new health bar, and the lighting of blocks have been reworked to make the blocks look a bit more 3-dimensional. However, this did not help to make Minecraft look more realistic; the shadows still look as if they were drawn with paint, and the fog at the far end of the world still clouds any mystery that could be there...

That sounds familiar, doesn't it?

That's right: The early version of Minecraft satisfies all three categories of a liminal space:
1. There is an absence of players and decorations,
2. The far end of the world is covered in thick, artificial fog, and
3. The shadowing is similar to, but not convincingly, the reality.

Sure, one can argue that the textures at this point is nowhere near a photograph and that it doesn't satisfy the prominent feature of liminal spaces, the feeling of familiarity. 

However, as declared by early Minecraft Forum users, a 3D, first-person survival game like Minecraft is already immersing enough to have people "suspend the disbelief" and imagine that they're not controlling a player, but living in this eerie, dangerous world themselves.
