I'm fricking trembling.

At first I thought it's another one of those cryptic Lovecraftian horror where nothing really makes sense. But *NOPE*. It is so well thought-out and executed that really nothing was unclear. The audience gets to know every single bit of strength and weaknesses and lore and behavior about that thing, and yet we are still horribly unsettled. Really, it is when you think you understand something and still realize that very void at the midst of our capacity that you lose all hope and wait, passively, for the outcome.

Film theory wise, the producers have used everything possible to make the film as otherworldly as possible. 

The most noticeable thing might be the use of almost purely nondiegetic sound effects; characters naturally speak over environmental ambience, insignificant objects turn out to be incredibly loud, and even supposedly diegetic sounds like songs from a record player can go through walls and change in tone. Surely this detatches the sense of reality from the film, but that isn't a bad thing - it firstly suggests that the world it happens in is not "normal", thus keeping the audience creeped out even when there really isn't anything happening, and also blends in the otherwise incongruent "weird" sounds by making them indistinguishable from the "normal" ones.

*Nope* also has some interesting cinematography and editing choices. Still shots are sometimes used in the first quarter of the film, which, while giving us longer time to study and memorize the protagonists, also helps setting an early tone of confusion and uneasiness. This sense of uncertainty and insecurity is further supported by occasionally refusing to cut to the subject of interest, in addition to classic techniques such as long takes and negative space. 

With so many things happening though, the film needs something to remind the audience of how events link with each other, and flashbacks, recurring camera angles, and even usage of the exact same takes, do exactly that. They act as unchanging clues in the story, aiding the audience in recalling, with the character, things happened earlier that turn out useful in the occasion.

Finally, Nope definitely has one of the most stunning visual effects of all Lovecraftian films I've watched. I can see glimpses of Alien in the interior design of the entity, while the exterior, though initially in the facade of a stereotypical UFO, curiously deviated from the common approach with fractals and shifting color patterns, and instead set its root in mundane textures like textile and ribbon. The effect this created is surely one-of-a-type; what's originally indescribable now gains a solid foundation, moving past the veil of "fiction" and entering the realm of the tangible. We may now look at, talk about, illustrate, recall, and relate to and from, this unfathomable object.

This has to be the only film to have me voluntarily watch till the end while embracing myself in terror. I would put it in the same tier with Annihilation - also one of the best. Now if you will, I need to recover some of my lost sanity.
