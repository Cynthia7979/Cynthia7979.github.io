I also have a Chinese blog [at this address](cynthia-s-cabin.wikidot.com) that's lacking maintenance. I'll not delete or move existing content, but any new content will be updated here. This blog's pretty much a combination of Chinese and English contents, and you'll know which language they're in when you see each of my blogs.

    <b><a href="https://cynthia7979.github.io/ideas/facts-father-son-earthquake">《地震中的父与子》究竟发生在哪？——深挖语文教材中的乌龙</a>
    <span class="date">2022/6/21</span></b>
    <p>
    《地震中的父与子》是人教版语文教材曾经的选文之一。然而，它因为记载的地震年份不准确而引起了大量争议。今天刚吃到这个瓜的我决定深挖一下其中的历史缘由……而且wow，我还真挖到了不少东西。

    <b><a href="https://cynthia7979.github.io/ideas/end-of-the-f---king-world-review">Web Series Review: <i>End of the F***king World</i> (2017)</a>
    <span class="date">Jun 4, 2022</span></b>
    <p>
    As a form of entertainment in the long days without any important tasks and nowhere to go hang out at, I began watching web series on Netflix. A lot of them are good - especially Love, Death, & Robots which I reviewed at my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/Cynthia7979/">Letterboxd</a> - but this one, specifically, is horrible. So, I have listed a few reasons in <a href="https://cynthia7979.github.io/ideas/end-of-the-f---king-world-review">my new blog </a>to illustrate why you really shouldn't watch this series. That is, if you're a film lover like me and can't stand long and boring interpersonal relationships.

    <b><a href="https://cynthia7979.github.com/ideas/annihilation-review">New Film Review: <i>Annihilation</i> (2018)</a>
    <span class="date">May 8, 2022</span></b>
    <p>
    I found this elegantly made film <i>Annihilation</i> (2018) and I'm running to let you know about it. It is a Lovecraftian / Cosmic Horror film, so you are safe from excessive jumpscares. It has a well-paced storyline and beautiful soundtrack and post-production effects. I absolutely suggest you try it out and see if it fits your taste.

    <p>
    After two visits, I made what's now the Universal Resort Beijing Review. It'll tell you what I strongly recommend or suggest you avoid. It's written in Chinese, but feel free to message me if you would like a translation. I would be happy to do so!
