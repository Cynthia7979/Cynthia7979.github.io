I also have a Chinese blog [at this address](cynthia-s-cabin.wikidot.com) that's lacking maintenance. I'll not delete or move existing content, but any new content will be updated here. This blog's pretty much a combination of Chinese and English contents, and you'll know which language they're in when you see each of my blogs.

    <b>截至今天，在之前被收录的57个《合成大西瓜》版本中，有27个（47%）已经下线
    <span class="date">2023/2/7</span></b>
    <p>
    好久不见。如果你最近点开了我的主页，就会发现我更新了<a href="https://cynthia7979.github.io/daxigua">合成大西瓜全集</a>。在一次失败的反拖延行动中我点开了这个至今已有两年历史的小游戏，然后发现——并不令人惊讶地——很多网页都下线了。
    </p><p>
    这也让我意识到两年已经过去了。人们已经找到了新的方向，许多曾经人尽皆知的“热点”也已经失去了热度，从人们的记忆里溜走了。如果没有现在还留下来的文章、视频为证，可能再过几年就没人会记得这个曾经的热搜了。这可能就是做archive的意义：它将一切似乎意义不大的东西都当作历史的一部分，保存在人类共同的记忆里。或许有一天我们会用到这些，或许不会，但是它是不会那样简单地被遗去的。
    </p><p>
    接下来的时间里我会继续更新<a href="https://cynthia7979.github.io/www-dict">不完全网络用语中英词典</a>，但我接下来的计划是将这个页面转移到一个新的网站上，给它搭载上搜索、例句等功能（相当于双语版的Urban Dictionary)。鉴于现在的任务量，这个的完成时间（和网站的更新速率）可能会很慢。但是嘛，人总是要有梦想的。
    </p><p>
    感谢你的来访，下次再见。

    It's been some time. You may have noticed that I updated the <a href="https://cynthia7979.github.io/daxigua">Synthetic Watermelon Compendium</a>. I began fuddling through that page in the middle of a failing fight against procrastination. What I found is that, somewhat unsurprisingly, many of the sites are no longer running.
    </p><p>
    This reminded me that it's been two years since that mini game came out. That trend, once so well-known and hyped up, has exhausted that ten minutes of its and left the open stage. It has became a fuzzy part of the memory, prone to be blown away if one day all proofs of its existence are gone...
    </p><p>
    But, we don't want them gone. That's probably why we value archives. Archivers treat everything, however seemingly trivial, as a part of a great narrative, storing them into a corner of the collective memory, where things wouldn't be lost as easily.
    </p><p>
    That said, I have a new plan for the <a href="https://cynthia7979.github.io/www-dict">Incomplete Internet Slang Dictionary</a>. I consider the table view as it is now is not the most friendly to browse. So, I'll try to get a new structured site up and running. It'll have features such as sample sentences and built-in searching - consider it a bilingual variant of Urban Dictionary. Currently though, I'm not having the most of leisure, so this could be pushed back for some time. It'll be there some day, so keep your expectations.
    </p><p>
    Thank you for reading. See you in the next post.

    <b><a href="https://cynthia7979.github.io/ideas/facts-father-son-earthquake">《地震中的父与子》究竟发生在哪？——深挖语文教材中的乌龙</a>
    <span class="date">2022/6/21</span></b>
    <p>
    《地震中的父与子》是人教版语文教材曾经的选文之一。然而，它因为记载的地震年份不准确而引起了大量争议。今天刚吃到这个瓜的我决定深挖一下其中的历史缘由……而且wow，我还真挖到了不少东西。

    <b><a href="https://cynthia7979.github.io/ideas/end-of-the-f---king-world-review">Web Series Review: <i>End of the F***king World</i> (2017)</a>
    <span class="date">Jun 4, 2022</span></b>
    <p>
    As a form of entertainment in the long days without any important tasks and nowhere to go hang out at, I began watching web series on Netflix. A lot of them are good - especially <i>Love, Death, & Robots</i> which I reviewed at my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/Cynthia7979/">Letterboxd</a> - but this one, specifically, is horrible. So, I have listed a few reasons in <a href="https://cynthia7979.github.io/ideas/end-of-the-f---king-world-review">my new blog </a>to illustrate why you really shouldn't watch this series. That is, if you're a film lover like me and can't stand long and boring interpersonal relationships.

    <b><a href="https://cynthia7979.github.com/ideas/annihilation-review">New Film Review: <i>Annihilation</i> (2018)</a>
    <span class="date">May 8, 2022</span></b>
    <p>
    I found this elegantly made film <i>Annihilation</i> (2018) and I'm running to let you know about it. It is a Lovecraftian / Cosmic Horror film, so you are safe from excessive jumpscares. It has a well-paced storyline and beautiful soundtrack and post-production effects. I absolutely suggest you try it out and see if it fits your taste.

    After two visits, I made what's now the Universal Resort Beijing Review. It'll tell you what I strongly recommend or suggest you avoid. It's written in Chinese, but feel free to message me if you would like a translation. I would be happy to do so!
